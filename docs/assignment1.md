# Personal information
### I am Elina Antonova, s1057069, first-year Comouting Science student.
I am 22-years-old and I moved to Nijmegen in 2020 from Tallinn, Estonia, where I used to live my whole life. I have graduated from Tallinn University of Technology in 2020 with Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Cum Laude). During the last year at the university I was working as C# developer in Bait Partner, but had to quit when moving here. I am following Computing Science bachelor course, because I am interested to study Software Science Master's course.

I was doing figure skating for 8 years until I quit in 2012. Currently I am interested in pole dancing, however, with all corona regulations it is now impossible to do it. I am also a member of Lasya (pole dance) sport association and active Thalia member (First-year committee).  

# Computer setup

I have previous Git and GitHub experience, so setting up my GitHub project was not hard and I managed to do it pretty fast. However, I had many problems with Docker.

I have started with upgrading my Windows to Education version and it was not a big problem. Then I activated the Hyper-V (using Programs and Features) and when computer restart happened, I saw blue screen with sad smiley. After computer restarted again it went through repair process. When installing Docker, the same situation with restart happened and my pc managed to turn on through repair process. However, Docker was not successfully installed and if corrupted my computer work as well: when I tried to log in using PIN of my account - I only saw the message that my PIN is not currently reachable (or something similar) and the only way I managed to get access to my comuter was using "Forgot PIN" feature with email sending and verification code usage. Also, I couldn't change my PIN later, because Windows suggested to try it later and no luck throughout 4 days. I ended up reinstalling Windows and it, of course, fixed the problem after spending 3 hours on trying to fix my PIN problem on Friday. The first thing I did after reinstall was Hyper-V enabling and Docker install, which were not that smooth, but worked at the end. 

My current PC setup: 
- AMD Ryzen 7 4800H
- 16 GB RAM
- 391 GB empty disk space
- Latest Docked Desktop version

In Docker I tried all the commands from the 3rd part of the assignment: creating file in my Windows machine and copying it to Docker image, creating scala file inside the Docker image, removing unused Docker images (in my case it was HelloWorld image from part II of the assignment. Everything was successful. The only part that confused me was _docker run_, because I created many containers in the beginning and didn't know how to rerun the created one. I figured it out later in the assignment description, that container name was neede to rerun the created container. 

In conclusion, I think that except the problems with my Windows machine, everything else was smooth, because my previous experience and education came in handy in this assignment. I am looking forward to the assignments where we will apply theory learned in Big Data lectures.
